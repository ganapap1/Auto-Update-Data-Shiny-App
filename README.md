# Auto-Update-Data-Shiny-App
In this application, I have taken a CSV file and opened in Excel for convenience to alter and see how data on shiny app gets updated.  Further, I took another csv file and saved it the same name of my original file.  this app does not throw any error. it just takes the overwritten file and updates shiny app.  very interesting option
